2. **Financial Analysis:**

     -Net Sales: Net sales represent the total revenue a company earns after deducting returns, allowances, and discounts. It reflects the actual amount of money generated from selling 
                 products or services.<br>
     <br>        
     -Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): COGS represents the direct cost of producing the goods or services sold during a specific period. It includes costs like materials, labor, and 
                                 manufacturing overhead.<br>
                                 <br>
      COGS measures the efficiency of a company in producing goods or services and directly impacts its profitability. A lower COGS leads to higher gross profit.<br>
     <br>
     -Gross Margin: Gross margin is the difference between net sales and COGS. It reflects the profit earned after accounting for the direct costs of production.<br>
     <br>
      Formula: Gross Margin = Net Sales - COGS<br>
      Gross margin measures how efficiently a company converts its revenue into profit. It indicates how much profit is generated from each dollar of sales.<br>
      <br>
     -Gross Margin %: Gross margin percentage expresses the gross margin as a percentage of net sales.<br>
      <br>
      Formula: Gross Margin % = (Gross Margin / Net Sales) * 100%<br>
      Gross margin percentage provides a standardized way to compare the profitability of different companies, even across industries.
